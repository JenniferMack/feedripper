In the beginning it was one night, then it eventually became full weeks, full months and so on.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe treated him like our own, providing food, washing clothes, giving him snack money. But when I asked him to assist with basic house chores, he would laugh and find ways to not help. It would frustrate me but, not knowing him too well, I let it slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have never met his parents, and neither of them reached out to express gratitude for taking care of their kid. They have three other kids, and the pattern seems to be the same: pawn them off on other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the athletic season changed, and the boys were in different sports, so we got a break from supporting an extra person in February. My concern is, he is coming around again needing rides to school. I feel it is not my problem. This has led to some heavy discussions with my husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the boy\u0026#8217;s parents or grandparents need to take responsibility for assuring their child makes it to practice, has extra money to purchase snacks and has secured rides to and from school. He sees it differently. How can we let that boy fall through the cracks? Mind you, he wears name-brand clothes, glasses and shoes, yet his parents do not assist him in the most important aspects of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel horrible because I don\u0026#8217;t think it is our job to provide for him, but I try to teach my kids empathy and responsibility. So how do I justify myself? How do I get my husband to see we can\u0026#8217;t continue to be a crutch for these people? Or am I wrong?

That they would allow him to live with another family whom they haven\u0026#8217;t met is shocking. That they would expect you to foot the bill for all of his needs while they pretend they don\u0026#8217;t have a minor child for whom they are responsible is negligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he resumes staying with you, INSIST that he stop acting like a guest and assume the same responsibilities you have assigned to your own children! Your husband should back you up on this. Understand that if the boy is unwilling to do that, the example being set for your children is a very poor one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankly, I think child protective services should have been notified about what has been going on a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDEAR READERS:\u003c/strong\u003e This is National Women\u0026#8217;s Health Week, so I\u0026#8217;m offering a \u0026#8220;gentle reminder\u0026#8221; to make your health a priority.

More than 3,000 of the North Shore representative\u0026#8217;s supporters avidly packed two hotel ballrooms to hear the keynote speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the uber-powerful speaker of the U.S. House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho did Schakowsky invite to give greetings at the event? Lori Lightfoot, who received a standing ovation from the massive crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Rush’s turn.

Unfortunately as Kadner pointed out, those who are in the position to pay the most toward government goods and services control the government to manipulate the tax laws so that they can pay small amounts or nothing at all. Under the latest federal tax revisions, the corporate tax was reduced from 35% to 21%. In actuality, hardly any corporations were paying 35% taxes. Most paid around 19%, so now they will pay significantly less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eS\u003cem\u003eEND LETTERS TO \u003ca href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eletters@suntimes.com\u003c/a\u003e: \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne ad says Illinois taxes are among the most unfair in the nation. Asking a family of four with an income of maybe $35,000 to pay taxes at the same rate as a family making $100,000 seems to bear that out. Yet there are those in Illinois who continually try to sell this to Illinois residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIllinois has found ways to waste money for decades. Legislators are more worried about keeping their jobs than making hard choices in the best interests of the people. Our last government preyed upon the poor and powerless by cutting funding to programs, claiming that was how Illinois had to function to deal with its financial problems.

In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker pitched \u003ca href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/illinois-democratic-candidate-governor-jb-pritzker-2018-primary/\"\u003eIllinoisCares, public health insurance option plan,\u003c/a\u003e during his 2018 campaign. But so far none have passed legislation implementing a public option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackers acknowledge the rate caps at the heart of the plan risk creating coverage gaps in rural areas. But they hope to persuade doctors to accept lower rates by bringing the state\u0026#8217;s purchasing power to bear. The savings would be used to sell the plans at a competitive price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInslee, who is also running for president, embraced the idea based on early work by a state legislator and later officially requested the public option bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts sponsor, Seattle Sen. David Frockt, a Democrat, said the hybrid system was a compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;What\u0026#8217;s important about this plan is that the government is coming in and taking a more aggressive role in regulating the cost drivers of health care,\u0026#8221; Frockt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core proposition of Washington\u0026#8217;s plan, dubbed Cascade Care, is that it will save consumers money by capping payments to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost cap is central to the program\u0026#8217;s long-term survival: Set it too high, and there will be no savings to pass along. Set it too low, and the state runs the risk of providers declining the plan, leaving it to whither as consumers seek alternatives that provide more choice, said Jennifer Tolbert, director of the Kaiser Foundation\u0026#8217;s state health care analysis program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is especially critical in Washington\u0026#8217;s rural counties, many of which were already hit hardest by health care cost increases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo attract providers, Washington lawmakers chose a relatively high figure to start: The plan caps payouts at 160 percent of federal Medicare rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#8217;s more than other states have proposed. In New Mexico, lawmakers considered using Medicaid rates, among the lowest paid to doctors and hospitals by any insurance plan. Lobbying firm Manatt estimated that could have translated into cost savings for consumers of more than 20% compared with similar private plans on the individual market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy comparison, Washington\u0026#8217;s higher pay rate for doctors is estimated to save participants only 5 to 10%, according to Jason McGill, Inslee\u0026#8217;s senior policy adviser on health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even at the higher rate, the plan risks leaving coverage gaps in the least-populated counties, said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody, an early architect of the plan who chairs the House Health Care and Wellness committee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state has already had problems guaranteeing private coverage in those areas. Two counties were recently at risk of having no insurers offering individual plans, and others have only a single hospital or hospital network, allowing providers to drive up costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result has been rural areas bucking the state\u0026#8217;s broader trend of moderate cost increases: A quarter of Washington counties, mostly rural, have seen triple-digit increases in the cost of premiums for a benchmark bronze-level plan in the last year alone, with some rising by as much as three times the increase seen in King County, home of Seattle, according to data from the Kaiser Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother unique aspect of Washington\u0026#8217;s plan is its hybrid management model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite its name, the public option won\u0026#8217;t be provided by the state itself, and state employees won\u0026#8217;t deal directly with patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, the measure directs state health care authorities to hire one or more private insurance companies: The state will determine the broad outlines of the public plans, but private companies will handle day-to-day administration, including enrolling patients and paying out claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;It\u0026#8217;s an attempt to keep the insurance companies in the game,\u0026#8221; said Aaron Katz, a University of Washington professor who teaches health policy and has studied U.S. health care markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike earlier decisions to have private companies administer parts of the Medicare and Medicaid systems in some states, Washington\u0026#8217;s hybrid model tries to preserve some competition while fixing problems like stability and coverage gaps, Kaatz said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it also has the effect of weaving insurance companies further into the fabric of public health care — potentially creating a barrier for later efforts to move to a completely public system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#8220;The size of the business that we are giving to private insurers makes it ever more difficult to ever extract ourselves from those dependencies,\u0026#8221; Katz said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s also a departure from public option proposals that have cropped up in other states, where lawmakers have mostly tried to broaden eligibility for programs like Medicaid, said Emily Blanford of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, a hybrid model theoretically has some advantages, Blanford said, including allowing the state to start from scratch designing rates and provider networks without needing a new program and staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

			"text": "\u003cp\u003eIf you’re going to dream, dream big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Bulls, the biggest dream is to win the NBA lottery Tuesday night, which would allow them to take Duke star Zion Williamson with the first pick in the June 20 draft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would change – what’s the word? \u0026#8212; everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not hyperbole. That’s how good and different the kid is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo let’s dream big. Let’s dream that the Bulls will be the big winners, that they’ll do the right thing, that they won’t do anything stupid. Let’s dream of a core of Williamson, Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine. Let’s dream that a healthy Wendell Carter Jr. is indeed the player the Bulls think he is. Let’s dream that, when you stir all these ingredients together, you have the makings of a championship team down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bulls did not give themselves the best chance to win Tuesday’s lottery. They didn’t lose often enough last season, choosing the development of their young players over unabashed tanking and the possibility of getting a once-in-a-generation talent. They finished with the fourth-worst record in the NBA. It means they’ll have a 12.5 percent chance of securing the first pick Tuesday instead of the 14 percent chance the three teams with the worst records each will have. No big deal, many of you are saying. But if this were the 1984 draft, would you rather have a 14 percent chance of getting Michael Jordan or a 12.5 percent chance of getting him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one is saying that Williamson has Jordan’s abilities. And maybe Williamson will turn out to be this draft’s Sam Bowie, whom Portland infamously took one spot before Jordan in 1984. But I’ll take my chances on being wrong about Zion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s raw. There’s no doubt about that. He was able to bull his way to the hoop in college. That won’t be as easy in the NBA, where there’s always somebody else to meet you at the rim if you happen to get past your man. He needs to work hard on his outside shot. If he learns to hit a three-pointer consistently, forget it. No one will be able to stop him. There hasn’t been a player with his size (6-foot-7, 284 pounds), his jumping ability (45-inch vertical leap) and his talent in the league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut dreaming big shouldn’t be limited to Williamson and the first pick. He’s not the only player who could help the Bulls turn the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they land the second pick in the draft, Murray State’s Ja Morant would answer their need at point guard. He’s extremely gifted. The easiest thing in the world would have been for him to hog the ball at mid-major Murray State. Instead, he led the nation in assists with 10 a game. That was more than two assists per game better than his nearest competitor. He also found time to average 24.5 points a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you can dream big about Morant taking the ball to the hoop for a massive dunk, something you normally wouldn’t expect from someone 6-3, 174 pounds. Or you can dream big about him making the sweet-shooting Markkanen a star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Duke’s RJ Barrett will turn out to be the biggest prize of the draft. Maybe the Bulls won’t get as lucky as they had hoped in the lottery but will get lucky enough to pick third when the draft rolls around next month. Barrett averaged 22.6 points a game his freshman year, which is exactly what teammate Williamson averaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe likes to have the ball in his hands, and that could be an issue if the ball\u0026#8217;s always in LaVine’s hands. It’s a problem that coach Jim Boylen would love to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the lottery – projecting, imagining, dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliamson is the massive trophy. He’s a walking, talking, dunking eclipse. But the other two players would be worth celebrating if the Bulls’ logo is on the second or third ping-pong ball selected Tuesday night. It\u0026#8217;s called a win-win-win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, the dreaming goes through significant downsizing. Getting excited will take more effort. Yahoo Sports has the Bulls grabbing Virginia guard De’Andre Hunter with the fourth pick. An ACC assistant coach said of him, “He has the potential to be a great defensive player at the next level.’’ That sounds uncomfortably close to what everybody said about Kris Dunn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the worst happens and the Bulls end up picking eighth in the first round? It could happen. There’s a 2.2 percent chance of that disaster befalling them, but it could happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, that’s not the worst thing that could transpire Tuesday! The Bulls could win the lottery and then draft a relatively obscure player whom their scouts absolutely adore! The horror!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOK, calm down, big fella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the time for dreaming big, remember? This is no time to think about the Bulls paying for not playing the rebuild game correctly. This is the time to remember that team vice president John Paxson had a 1.7 percent chance of getting the top pick in the 2008 draft and pulled a rabbit out of his hat, winning the right to take Derrick Rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDream big like that. You’ll sleep much better Monday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n"
