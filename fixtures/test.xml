																		<description><![CDATA[One mom is torn about providing food, money and rides when the neglectful family's 15-year-old, a friend of her son. keeps coming around.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><strong>DEAR ABBY:</strong> My 15-year-old son has a friend who stayed with us for five months during football and basketball season because he didn&#8217;t have transportation to early-morning practices. In the beginning it was one night, then it eventually became full weeks, full months and so on.</span></p>
<p>We treated him like our own, providing food, washing clothes, giving him snack money. But when I asked him to assist with basic house chores, he would laugh and find ways to not help. It would frustrate me but, not knowing him too well, I let it slide.</p>
<p>We have never met his parents, and neither of them reached out to express gratitude for taking care of their kid. They have three other kids, and the pattern seems to be the same: pawn them off on other people.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the athletic season changed, and the boys were in different sports, so we got a break from supporting an extra person in February. My concern is, he is coming around again needing rides to school. I feel it is not my problem. This has led to some heavy discussions with my husband.</p>
<p>I feel the boy&#8217;s parents or grandparents need to take responsibility for assuring their child makes it to practice, has extra money to purchase snacks and has secured rides to and from school. He sees it differently. How can we let that boy fall through the cracks? Mind you, he wears name-brand clothes, glasses and shoes, yet his parents do not assist him in the most important aspects of his life.</p>
<p>I feel horrible because I don&#8217;t think it is our job to provide for him, but I try to teach my kids empathy and responsibility. So how do I justify myself? How do I get my husband to see we can&#8217;t continue to be a crutch for these people? Or am I wrong? Help! <em>— TRYING TO HELP IN THE SOUTH</em></p>
<p><strong>DEAR TRYING TO HELP:</strong> Your &#8220;houseguest&#8221; may have name-brand clothes, glasses and shoes, but from your description, he is being severely neglected by his parents. That they would allow him to live with another family whom they haven&#8217;t met is shocking. That they would expect you to foot the bill for all of his needs while they pretend they don&#8217;t have a minor child for whom they are responsible is negligence.</p>
<p>If he resumes staying with you, INSIST that he stop acting like a guest and assume the same responsibilities you have assigned to your own children! Your husband should back you up on this. Understand that if the boy is unwilling to do that, the example being set for your children is a very poor one.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think child protective services should have been notified about what has been going on a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR READERS:</strong> This is National Women&#8217;s Health Week, so I&#8217;m offering a &#8220;gentle reminder&#8221; to make your health a priority. Eat healthy, allow time for exercise, manage your stress levels, get the sleep you need and schedule that appointment to see your doctor or dentist that you&#8217;ve been postponing. Take steps to eliminate behaviors that put you at risk — smoking, texting at the wheel and driving without wearing a seatbelt.</p>
<p>Your most precious possession is your health, so please take care of it. For more information, visit <a href="http://womenshealth.gov."><em>womenshealth.gov.</em> </a>— Love, ABBY</p>

<p>Pluto is energizing the sun in your sign, which makes this a powerful day for you, in many, many ways. However, I think the most important way that you are empowered today is that you can improve yourself. You can improve your image, your appearance, your style and your relationships. (Not too shabby.)</p>
</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-taurus">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-taurus"></i>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</h2>
<p>Those of you who are doing any kind of research or trying to find solutions to old questions will be successful today because the Force is with you. You will be able to delve deeply into what you are seeking or what you want to learn. Nothing will hold you back.</p>
</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-gemini">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-gemini"></i>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</h2>

</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-cancer">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-cancer"></i>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</h2>

</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-leo">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-leo"></i>Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)</h2>

<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-virgo"></i>Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)</h2>
<p>Today you might learn information that you want to know regarding your partner&#8217;s wealth or the wealth or earnings of someone else. You might also delve into secrets regarding insurance, wills, inheritances or anything to do with shared property. &#8220;I have x-ray vision.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-libra">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-libra"></i>Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)</h2>
<p>Your encounters with partners and close friends will be powerful and memorable today. In fact, you might attract someone to you who is impressive if not daunting. Nevertheless, your Libra charm will see you through because you value justice.</p>

<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-scorpio"></i>Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)</h2>

</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-sagittarius">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-sagittarius"></i>Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)</h2>
<p>Romance will be sizzling and sexy today — the stuff of movies! Likewise, sports events will be intense, aggressive and passionate in a competitive way. Whatever you do today will be edgy, and ideally, you will see ways to make things perform or run better.</p>

<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-capricorn"></i>Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)</h2>
<p>You can make improvements at home today especially in areas related to laundry, plumbing, garbage, recycling and bathrooms. Look around you to see which improvement really needs to be done.

</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-aquarius">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-aquarius"></i>Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)</h2>
<p>You are convincing and persuasive today — no question. However, you also can use your channeled mental focus to learn something new or discover hidden answers or new ways of doing something. Suddenly, you might see your daily environment with new eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-pisces">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-pisces"></i>Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)</h2>
<p>Because you are in a resourceful frame of mind today, you might see new uses for something that you already own. Could that lawnmower be a floor lamp? You might also see new ways to earn money, or perhaps you will find a better paying job? Ka-ching!</p>
</div>
<div class="scope-sign scope-sign-birthday-today">
<h2><i class="pull-right icon-xlarge zodiac-birthday"></i>If Your Birthday Is Today</h2>
<p>NBA veteran Dennis Rodman (1961) shares your birthday today. You are easygoing and patient. You are also determined, responsible and focused about getting whatever you want.

																		<description><![CDATA[Alas, it is only the second-greatest comeback in golf history and maybe the fifth-greatest comeback in sports history.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">T</span><span class="s1">iger Woods hysteria resumes this week at the PGA Championship, in the wake of his widely proclaimed ‘‘greatest comeback in sports history’’ last month at the Masters.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am going to say this one time and one time only, and I am going to be very, very, very, very, very clear about it:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was not the greatest comeback in sports history.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Alas, it is only the second-greatest comeback <i>in golf history</i>, maybe the fifth-greatest comeback in sports history and probably not among the 25,000 greatest comebacks in human history.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let’s start with golf comebacks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Tiger Woods:</b> Marital and back problems. Goes 11 years between major titles.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Ben Hogan:</b> Near-fatal car accident — fractured pelvis, chipped rib, broken collarbone, fractured ankle, blood clots, hospitalized 59 days, might never walk again — in 1949. Won U.S. Open in 1950.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let’s move on to a handful of other sports comebacks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Muhammad Ali:</b> At his career peak, the heavyweight champ was banned from boxing from 1967 to 1970 after refusing military service. Regained the heavyweight title twice after his return, including at age 32 in 1974, knocking out George Foreman in the ‘‘Rumble in the Jungle.’’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Greg LeMond:</b> In a hunting accident in 1987, the 1986 Tour de France champion was shot with 100 lead gun pellets in his back and right side, was airlifted to a hospital, lost 65 percent of his blood volume and was told he was within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. Returned to cycling and won the Tour again in 1989 and 1990.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Monica Seles:</b> Ranked No. 1 in the world, she was stabbed in the back with a 9-inch blade by a 38-year-old spectator while playing a tennis tournament in Germany in 1993. Did not play for two years, resumed in 1995, then won her 10th and final Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in 1996.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>George Foreman:</b> Lost his title to Ali in 1974, quit boxing in 1977, became an ordained minister, returned in 1987, became the oldest heavyweight champ ever in 1994 at age 45 and launched a line of George Foreman Grills that can be found in garage sales from Peoria to Poughkeepsie.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">(Going back to Tiger for a moment: In all fairness, he had four back surgeries <i>and</i> lost his Gatorade endorsement deal.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let’s finish up this week’s work — it’s amazing they still pay me for this — by running down some great, unlikely comebacks elsewhere in life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Richard Nixon:</b> Lost to JFK in 1960, lost California gubernatorial race in 1962 and retired from politics. Unretired to win the presidency in 1968 and 1972. P.S.: If he subsequently had bounced back from Watergate, you could retire the ‘‘greatest comeback’’ award in his name.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Robert Downey Jr.:</b> From a 1992 Academy Award nomination to unemployable addict — drug abuse, multiple rehabs and some jail time between 1996 and 2001 — to fronting huge movie franchises such as ‘‘Iron Man’’ and ‘‘Sherlock Holmes.’’</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Ulysses S. Grant:</b> Entered the Army, quit the Army, drank excessively, fell into depression and struggled as a civilian. After rejoining the Army during the Civil War, he was promoted to top general of the Union forces, kicked the Confederacy’s butt and twice was elected president. On $50 bill.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>John Travolta:</b> Vinnie Barbarino, ‘‘Saturday Night Fever’’ and ‘‘Grease,’’ then nothing for a decade, then ‘‘Pulp Fiction’’ got him A-listed to the head of the Spago reservations line.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Japan and Germany:</b> Both were written off after World War II. You wouldn’t believe what Skip Bayless said about them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Old Spice:</b> They went from smelling like your grandfather to ‘‘smell like a man, man.’’ Sources tell me Vladimir Putin and Justin Bieber douse themselves in it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Betty White:</b> The woman is 97 years old and still gets work. Somewhere in there at some time, she had to make a comeback from something.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Mayonnaise:</b> Every time you think it’s out, it gets pulled back into the condiment game.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Lazarus:</b> Uh, he was dead. And then he wasn’t.</span></p>

																		<description><![CDATA[The Cubs, who are off Monday, ended an 8-2 homestand two games in front of the Brewers in the NL Central after taking two of three in the series.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One day after catching 15 innings in nasty weather Saturday, Cubs catcher Willson Contreras didn’t even think about taking the game off Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘Because I’m ready to go,’’ he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That has been the general vibe for the Cubs, who beat the Brewers 4-1 to complete an 8-2 homestand. Jon Lester allowed an unearned run and threw 116 pitches in 6 2/3 innings, Javy Baez had the go-ahead double in the fifth and Kris Bryant added a two-run home run in the seventh. Brandon Kintzler worked 1 1/3 scoreless innings before Steve Cishek pitched the ninth for his second save.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cubs, who are off Monday, ended their homestand two games in front of the Brewers after taking two of three in the series.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘Really an interesting, well-played game,’’ manager Joe Maddon said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Things have been interesting in a good way for Contreras.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a trying 2018, Contreras is back to being the player the Cubs expect. He is hitting .304, and his walk-off homer in the 15th Saturday was his 10th of the season, matching his total from last season.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering his recent form and the fact Lester was pitching, it probably wasn’t that surprising Contreras was<br />
behind the plate. There were also a couple of other reasons he wasn’t going to sit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘The love for the game and how much I want to win this game today,’’ Contreras said beforehand. ‘‘My mind is ready to go. I’m a little bit sore, but that doesn’t take away the love that I feel for this game.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The weekend series was the Brewers’ first visit to Wrigley since the National League Central tiebreaker last season, the first of two losses — the other came against the Rockies in the wild-card game — that sent the Cubs from home-field advantage in the NL playoffs to watching the rest of the postseason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whatever happened in the last three days wasn’t going to erase that entirely. But the result Sunday didn’t hurt, even though Lester wasn’t exactly popping champagne corks after the victory.</span></p>
<p><strong>RELATED</strong><br />
• <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/anthony-rizzo-back-out-of-cubs-starting-lineup-baez-could-get-rest-soon/">Anthony Rizzo (back) out of Cubs&#8217; lineup; Baez could get rest soon</a><br />

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘Anytime you win a series against somebody in your division, it’s always good,’’ Lester said. ‘‘You can’t read too much into it.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the Cubs scored an unearned run in the first, their defense returned the favor in the fourth. Christian Yelich led off and sent a fly ball to left field that Kyle Schwarber couldn’t handle, resulting in a three-base error when his diving try was unsuccessful. Jesus Aguilar followed with a tying single.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brewers eventually loaded the bases, but Lester got Orlando Arcia to ground into a force to end a 39-pitch inning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘He’s been so good at pitching through adversity, making pitches when he needs to,’’ Maddon said of Lester. ‘‘He’s really slowed the game down as well as you possibly can.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the fifth, Baez’s double to the gap in right-center drove in Bryant to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Even after Lester allowed a double and a single to begin the sixth, the Cubs retained the lead. With one out, Hernan Perez hit a soft grounder to Baez at short. He threw home to get Aguilar at the plate, and Lester got out of the jam.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lester ran out of steam with two outs in the seventh. He walked Lorenzo Cain and allowed a single to Yelich before Kintzler struck out Aguilar looking to end the threat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bryant then hit his two-run homer to left-center in the bottom of the inning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘[Bryant]<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>looks really sharp,’’ Maddon said. ‘‘His confidence is way up.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That also could be said of Contreras and the team as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘Great homestand, going back to the Cardinals,’’ Bryant said. ‘‘Weather, cold, not the greatest conditions to play in. Long games. Super proud of the way we’ve handled everything that we’ve been dealt.’’</span></p>

																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Shore man was charged with phoning in a bogus bomb threat and falsely reporting that officers had been shot in a series of 911 calls he allegedly made for his own enjoyment.</p>
<p>Terreance M. King Jr., 22, faces a felony count of disorderly conduct, according to Cook County court and Chicago police records.</p>

<p>During King’s initial court hearing Sunday, prosecutors said he used his own cellphone to call in 10 sham reports to Chicago’s emergency dispatch center.</p>
<p>During most of the calls, in which King allegedly used the aliases “Antoine” and “Whodie” to identify himself, he falsely claimed that officers had been wounded in shootings near his apartment, prosecutors said. Another time, he allegedly called in the bomb threat.</p>
<p>About 11:40 p.m. Friday, King was arrested on the street in the 7000 block of South Clyde Avenue when officers learned he was wanted for making the phony police reports, police said.</p>
<p>After allegedly admitting to making the calls, King said he routed officers to addresses near his home because he enjoyed watching emergency crews respond to the reports, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, prosecutors noted that King was convicted of aggravated sexual assault in 2011, when he was still a juvenile.</p>
<p>An assistant public defender assigned to King told Judge John F. Lyke Jr. that he has since graduated from high school and is now enrolled in Job Corps, the federally-funded program that offers free job training and educational opportunities to men and women in their teens and early-20s. The public defender then claimed that King had no cash to post bail.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lyke set King’s bail at $25,000 — meaning he’ll have to put up $2,500 to be released from the Cook County Jail. Should he be released, King will be placed on electronic monitoring and confined to the same apartment where he allegedly made the calls.</p>
<p>His next court date was set for Friday.</p>

																		<description><![CDATA[Manager Joe Maddon kept Rizzo out of the lineup Sunday against the Brewers. Meanwhile, a more planned day off might be coming soon for Javy Baez.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cubs manager <b>Joe Maddon</b> kept first baseman <b>Anthony Rizzo</b> out of the starting lineup Sunday. Meanwhile, a more planned day off might be coming soon for shortstop <b>Javy Baez</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After his back tightened up during the 15-inning marathon Saturday, Rizzo wasn’t in the starting lineup for the series finale against the Brewers. Rizzo, who kept trying to stretch his back Saturday, was available to pinch-hit, and the Cubs were planning to see how he feels after their day off Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rizzo texted Maddon on Sunday to tell him about the issue. After a phone call between the two, Rizzo went to Wrigley Field to try to loosen up, but his back didn’t respond well enough for him to be in the lineup.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘Been there, done that before,’’ Maddon said. ‘‘It’s not like it’s a surprise to anybody. The first time it’s a little bit more stressful, thinking that it might be something more serious.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for Baez, he has played in all 38 games but might be getting a breather soon. Maddon said he’s ‘‘trying to work on that right now,’’ regardless of Rizzo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘It’s one of those things you’ve got to do, regardless,’’ Maddon said. ‘‘I’m looking at some different things on the back side of the day off right now.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Rizzo out, <b>Kris Bryant</b> started at first base.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s2">Descalso starts</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Daniel Descalso</b> made his first start since May 4. He batted seventh, played second base and went 0-for-3.</span></p>
<p><strong>RELATED</strong><br />

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Descalso had a minor issue with his left ankle but didn’t go on the injured list. He had been 0-for-5 in six appearances as a pinch hitter since his last start.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘He’s hit some balls decently as a pinch hitter, but I just wanted to bring him back slowly,’’ Maddon said. ‘‘I do like him there. That 7-hole has a tendency to get people on base. He’s been doing a great job there, too.’’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s2">Edwards getting back</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since his recall May 6, reliever <b>Carl Edwards Jr.</b> has thrown three scoreless innings. Maddon said he’s seeing Edwards throw with a more repeatable delivery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘He’s not worried about trying to be so deceptive; he’s being a little more natural,’’ Maddon said. ‘‘Just being Carl. Not trying to do all those little different histrionic things with his foot. Just pitching.’’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Edwards also isn’t trying to be so fine with his pitches, which is fine with Maddon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘‘He’ll know when he’s able to dot it up,’’ Maddon said. ‘‘But if you’re trying to dot it up and you’re not really there, don’t try that. I’d much prefer him to just attack in strike mode with his stuff, as opposed to try to be this finely tuned guy that’s always nibbling at corners. That’s not who he is.’’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s2">Russell’s progress</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Addison Russell</b>, who entered the game at second as part of a double switch in the seventh inning, is 1-for-8 since rejoining the Cubs after his 40-game suspension for domestic abuse. Maddon said he has seen some ‘‘really good passes’’ from Russell, but his timing isn’t quite right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensively, Maddon said Russell is up to speed.</span></p>

																		<description><![CDATA[The vibes surrounding the White Sox this season are night and day compared to 2018.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TORONTO — Shortstop Tim Anderson didn’t have a chance to celebrate his three-run home run to center with a flashy bat flip. In the split-second Anderson was debating whether he should do it, he heard manager Rick Renteria yelling at him to run.</p>
<p>After he rounded the bases and made his way to the dugout, Anderson exchanged high-fives and smiles with teammates. He also executed a complicated handshake with rookie outfielder Eloy Jimenez in celebration.</p>
<p>“We’re all kids,” Anderson said after the White Sox’ 5-1 victory against the Blue Jays. “We like to have fun.”</p>
<p>The vibe surrounding this Sox team is night and day compared to 2018.</p>
<p>A year ago Sunday, the Sox, having lost seven in a row, were at their lowest point of the season. ­After a 3-2 start, they spiraled out of control and were losers of 25 of 31 games.</p>
<p>As the losses piled up, it became increasingly difficult to find silver linings in each game.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t been the case this year.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot more fun [this season],” Anderson said. “We’re doing our own thing, so it’s cool. We’ve been having a good time.”</p>
<p>Said right-hander Lucas Giolito: “The vibes in the clubhouse, in the dugout, we’re loose. Even if we’re down a couple of runs in a game, we know that our bats are really good. We can come back late in the game, tie a game up. . . . All around, I think everybody is kind of jelling more and more each day. We’re having more fun on the plane, on the bus, and that camaraderie is coming out on the field.”</p>
<p>The Sox have an 18-21 record compared to a 10-29 mark last season after 39 games. As expected, they’re still experiencing growing pains, but several key players have shown noticeable improvement, ­including Anderson and Yoan Moncada.</p>
<p>Anderson, who already has eight home runs, had his sixth game of three or more hits, tying him with Twins infielder Jorge Polanco for the American League lead. He’s hitting .331.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moncada, who’s hitting .277, is showing improved judgment at the plate. He has seven homers and 26 RBI.</p>
<p>Jimenez, who is out with a high ankle sprain but is expected to start a minor-league rehab assignment early this week, also has shown flashes in his first season in the majors.</p>
<p>“We have seen growth,” Renteria said. “Right now, we’re certainly in a better place, I believe. I think that the younger guys that we expect to improve are improving, and the overall well-being of the clubhouse is more solid right now than it was last year.”</p>
<p>Renteria, however, hasn’t lost sight of the Sox’ main objective.</p>
<p>“Our goal or our view of where we’re at as an organization and as a club continues to be looking forward,” Renteria said. “My concern is how well we play because these guys are developing, and if we play good baseball, that process takes care of the wins and losses. And I think we’re in a better place, for sure.”</p>
<p>Anderson said the positive energy is contagious among his teammates.</p>
<p>“We’ve been playing pretty well,” he said. “We’re coming together as a team, and I think we all know what we’re trying to do, and that’s go out and play hard and see what happens. And good things have been happening.”</p>

																		<description><![CDATA[Since Lucas Giolito returned from the injured list (hamstring) earlier this month, he has been dominant. ]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TORONTO — In the first inning, right-hander Lucas Giolito started to look like his old self. He allowed three hits and a run and had gotten only one out.</p>
<p>In the past, Giolito had a tendency to let innings spiral out of control. But that wasn’t the case Sunday in the White Sox’ 5-1 victory against the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre.</p>
<p>Rather than stressing about the two men on base, Giolito took a second to regroup. He focused on his breathing and locked in.</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>Giolito retired the next two batters. And in the next six innings, he allowed only one hit.</p>
<p>“[It was] the most important factor,” said Giolito, who walked one batter and tied his season high with eight strikeouts. “Last year, that’s one of those innings that would’ve gotten away from me, give up three runs, put myself in a hole at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>“Now when I have runners on base [and] I have zero outs, it’s all about coming back to breathe, resetting everything and having the trust that I’m going to be executing that pitch and doing it over and over and over again until I’m out of that inning.”</p>
<p>Since Giolito returned from the injured list (strained left hamstring) this month, he has been dominant. He’s 2-0 with a 1.86 ERA and 23 strikeouts in three starts.</p>
<p>Asked if this is the best command he has seen from Giolito, manager Rick Renteria said: “It’s close to it.”</p>
<p>Renteria gave credit to Giolito for not getting rattled by the rough start.</p>
<p>“Those are some of the things that experience, time and trust start to allow you to be able to work through, [not] allow moments to take a hold of you and shake you,” Renteria said. “He kept his composure, and he did a really nice job. He’s maturing. This young man has done a lot to put himself in a better place, and it’s noticeable.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>Outfielders Nicky Delmonico and Leury Garcia suffered injuries in this series.</p>
<p>Delmonico is day-to-day with a sore left shoulder.</p>
<p>Renteria said his decision to remove Delmonico from the lineup for the series finale was made with an “abundance of caution.” The injury occurred in the fourth inning Saturday when Delmonico tried to make a diving catch, Renteria said.</p>
<p>Garcia left the game Sunday with stiffness in his lower back. While catching a fly ball in the third inning, he ran backward into an unpadded part of the center-field wall. After the collision, Garcia remained face down on the warning track and seemed to be in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>He stayed in the game the rest of the inning but was replaced by Jose Rondon for his next at-bat. Charlie Tilson moved to center, and Rondon took over Tilson’s spot in left field.</p>
<p>After the game, Renteria said Garcia got the wind knocked out of him. He’s also day-to-day.</p>
<p><strong>Pink out</strong></p>
<p>The Sox and Jays paid homage to mothers everywhere by adding a splash of color to their uniforms.</p>
<p>The teams joined Major League Baseball in wearing pink-accented hats, socks and gloves for Mother’s Day. The gear will be available for purchase, with proceeds going to MLB charities, including Susan G. Komen and Stand Up To Cancer.</p>

																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MIAMI — The Rolling Loud Music Festival celebrating global hip-hop artists in South Florida did not go so well for Kodak Black and Lil Wayne.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release that Black was arrested Saturday at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The statement said he was charged with a crime in connection with weapons, but didn&#8217;t elaborate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lil Wayne said on social media that he refused to perform after being subjected to a search by security personnel or police. It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear Sunday who had done the pat-down on the superstar rapper, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s what he had to say on <a href="https://twitter.com/LilTunechi/status/1127378043486519296">Twitter:</a></p>
<p>&#8220;To all my fans who came to see me at Rolling Loud, I&#8217;m sorry but I won&#8217;t be performing,&#8221; the post says. &#8220;The Festival Police (Not Rolling Loud) made it mandatory that I had to be policed and checked to get on the stadium grounds. I do not and will not ever settle for being policed to do my job.&#8221;</p>

Rap star Lil Wayne says he did not perform as scheduled Saturday, May 11, 2019 at the Rolling Loud festival at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens because he was searched by law enforcement officers. The rapper said on social media Saturday that he would not perform at the Rolling Loud festival at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens because police \&quot;made it mandatory\&quot; that he was searched before the show. Rapper Kodak Black was arrested on weapons charges before the show.

<p>Lil Wayne has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. According to his Twitter post, he later performed at the Story nightclub in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>As for Kodak Black, whose current name is Bill Kapri and who was born as Dieuson Octave to Haitian American parents in Florida, this arrest is the latest in a lengthy rap sheet he has assembled at the age of 21.</p>
<p>Most recently, Black was arrested last month on drug and weapons charges as he crossed from Canada into the U.S. near Niagara Falls, New York. In Florida, he has been charged at different times with drug and weapons possession, armed robbery, sexual assault, probation violations and fleeing from officers.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Miami-Dade County police were also involved in his most recent arrest.</p>
<p>Authorities say Black will make an initial appearance in Miami federal court Monday. Court records don&#8217;t list a lawyer for him.</p>

																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LONDON  — A well-known Mexican wrestler who co-starred in the comedy &#8220;Nacho Libre&#8221; has died of a suspected heart attack after collapsing on stage in London.</p>
<p>Cesar Cuauhtemoc Gonzalez Barron, the lucha libre star known as Silver King, performed Saturday night at The Roundhouse. The north London venue said Sunday on Twitter that he died during the event and more information about the circumstances are being pursued.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old Gonzalez appeared as a champion wrestler and comic villain in the 2006 movie &#8220;Nacho Libre,&#8221; which starred Jack Black as a monk who wants to be a masked luchador. Lucha libre is a popular form of wrestling in Mexico that features colorful masks, elaborate costumes and acrobatic techniques.</p>
<p>Lucha Libre World, which promoted the Roundhouse event, said in a statement the star &#8220;suffered what we believe was a cardiac arrest while performing in the show and sadly passed away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attendee Roberto Carrera Maldonado told the BBC the wrestler&#8217;s condition initially appeared &#8220;staged&#8221; as part of the fight, before efforts were made to revive him.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us were really shocked. It wasn&#8217;t clear what was happening,&#8221; Maldonado said. &#8220;I had the impression they didn&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The London Ambulance Service said medics arrived five minutes after they were called to the Roundhouse on Saturday, but the patient was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Silver King competed in World Championship Wrestling between 1997 and 2000.</p>

																		<description><![CDATA[In Chicago politics, there are two ways to rapprochement. There’s the smart, classy way, and the knuckle-headed way.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rapprochement is one of those lovely French words I love. It’s “an establishment or resumption of harmonious relations,” the Oxford online dictionary says.</p>
<p>In Chicago politics, there are two ways to rapprochement. There’s the smart, classy way, and the knuckle-headed way.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>OPINION</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Two ways, as illustrated last week by two prominent members of the U.S. Congress who prominently backed the wrong horse.</p>
<p>U.S. Reps. Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush endorsed and campaigned for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the recent mayoral runoff election. Their candidate lost to Lori Lightfoot in a landslide.</p>
<p>As Lightfoot’s inauguration approaches, it’s rapprochement time. Time to make amends, restore bonds and claim power.</p>
<p>On Monday, Schakowsky hosted Power Lunch, her annual don’t-miss political fundraiser. More than 3,000 of the North Shore representative&#8217;s supporters avidly packed two hotel ballrooms to hear the keynote speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the uber-powerful speaker of the U.S. House.</p>
<p>Who did Schakowsky invite to give greetings at the event? Lori Lightfoot, who received a standing ovation from the massive crowd.</p>
<p>It was Rush’s turn. The South Side congressman had viciously attacked Lightfoot during the runoff campaign. He argued, incorrectly, that the former Police Board president and chair of the Police Accountability Task Force would be a toady for a racist Chicago Police Department.</p>
<p>At a Preckwinkle campaign rally, Rush declared that “everyone who votes for Lori, the blood of the next young black man or black woman who is killed by the police is on your hands.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Rush attended a luncheon hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C. Lightfoot was the honored guest.</p>
<p>As Rush arrived, he told reporters he had not spoken to Lightfoot since the election.</p>
<p>“The campaign is over,” he was quoted as saying. “I wish the mayor well. I would be so overjoyed, very much overjoyed, if she became the best and most successful mayor that Chicago’s ever had. It would really make my heart glad.”</p>
<p>Reporters asked whether he would apologize to Lightfoot for his racially incendiary accusation.</p>
<p>“If she asks me to do it, then we’ll discuss it,” he said.</p>
<p>Lightfoot isn’t going to ask. She doesn’t have time for that.</p>
<p>Rush is an icon in black politics. In 1983, the Black Panther stalwart was elected 2nd Ward alderman. He was an invaluable ally of Harold Washington, Chicago’s first black mayor. Rush has been re-elected to Congress for decades with little serious opposition. One notable exception: In 2000, when a little-known state senator named Barack Obama took him on.</p>
<p>Rush beat him soundly.</p>
<p>Rush could be a potent ally for Lightfoot. He must be.</p>
<p>Lightfoot needs every iota of power, access and wisdom the veteran congressman can offer.</p>
<p>Rush needs “Landslide Lori,” who was elected Chicago’s first African-American woman and first LGBTQ mayor with nearly 74% of the vote.</p>
<p>Many of Rush’s constituents have even more dire needs. In this supposedly robust economy, African American families on Chicago’s South Side are buried in a landslide of violence, joblessness and poverty.</p>
<p>Lightfoot must govern citywide while also leaning in heavily to bring racial and gender equity to communities of color that have been left behind for decades. The communities Rush has represented for more than a quarter century.</p>
<p>Political rapprochement is not about apologies nor recriminations.</p>
<p>It should be about building power for good.</p>

																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a colder than normal start to the month of May, shorts and T-shirt weather is on the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like we&#8217;re finally breaking out of this persistently chilly pattern that we&#8217;ve had,&#8221; National Weather Service Meteorologist Ricky Castro said Sunday.</p>
<p>Highs that normally range in the upper 60s this time of year will return Tuesday after a modest warm up Monday that will feature highs in the high 50s, Castro said.</p>
<p>But, depending on wind direction, cool air generated by cold Lake Michigan water temps could ensure that areas near the lakefront remain chilly.</p>
<p>So far, May temperatures have been an average of 4.4 degrees cooler than normal, Castro said.</p>
<p>Only two days this month have cracked the 70 degree mark, compared to nine days up to this point in May 2018 — and five of those days were in the 80s, Castro said.</p>
<p>A recent glut of rainy weather, combined with the cold, has &#8220;made for a combination that a lot of people would consider pretty miserable,&#8221; Castro said, noting effects that ranged from flooding to canceled youth league sports.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there currently doesn&#8217;t appear to be any multiple-day heavy precipitation events in the forecast,&#8221; he said.</p>

																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CTA Red Line trains have resumed service after experiencing delays between the Howard and Addison stations on the North Side for a person who was hit by a train and killed at the Bryn Mawr stop.</p>
<p>The CTA announced the initial delay about 1:35 p.m. Sunday, citing a “medical emergency on the tracks.” The suspension of service was announced at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>A Chicago Fire Department spokesman confirmed that a person was hit by a train and said that recovery efforts are underway. The person was pronounced dead on the scene.</p>

																		<description><![CDATA[Phil Kadner was on the money with his assessment of the tax problems of our state.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Phil Kadner was on the money with <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/graduated-income-tax-fair-tax-j-b-pritzker-phil-kadner/">his assessment</a> of the tax problems of our state.</p>
<p>A key factor in all taxation is to make it fair. Unfortunately as Kadner pointed out, those who are in the position to pay the most toward government goods and services control the government to manipulate the tax laws so that they can pay small amounts or nothing at all. Under the latest federal tax revisions, the corporate tax was reduced from 35% to 21%. In actuality, hardly any corporations were paying 35% taxes. Most paid around 19%, so now they will pay significantly less.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>S<em>END LETTERS TO <a href="mailto:letters@suntimes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letters@suntimes.com</a>: </em></strong><em>Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>One ad says Illinois taxes are among the most unfair in the nation. Asking a family of four with an income of maybe $35,000 to pay taxes at the same rate as a family making $100,000 seems to bear that out. Yet there are those in Illinois who continually try to sell this to Illinois residents.</p>
<p>Illinois has found ways to waste money for decades. Legislators are more worried about keeping their jobs than making hard choices in the best interests of the people. Our last government preyed upon the poor and powerless by cutting funding to programs, claiming that was how Illinois had to function to deal with its financial problems. Yet by failing to negotiate a budget with the Legislature, a billion dollars were added to the debt due to penalties and late payments to creditors.</p>
<p>It appears the state government&#8217;s approach was &#8220;we will make the deal now and worry about how to pay for it later.&#8221; It&#8217;s later. Hopefully partisan politics and the Chicago vs. Downstate nonsense &#8220;feud&#8221; can be eliminated and actions taken to benefit everyone in the state, no matter their race, creed or location.</p>
<p><em>Daniel Pupo, Orland Park</em></p>
<p><strong>What has changed?</strong></p>
<p>Leave it to the evangelicals to force the Old Testament religion of Christianity down high school students’ throats by bringing bills before the state legislators to encourage or allow Bible study in schools. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kentucky-gives-blessing-bible-classes-public-schools-n777721">Kentucky is in the forefront</a>, and some 10 other states are dealing with such legislation. I seem to recall that Bible study was well-covered in Sunday School — what has changed?</p>
<p>No one seems to notice that our students really need civics classes much more than religion in our schools; numerous studies have exposed just how ignorant our society is of the principles and procedures that encompass our government. Is this perhaps the GOP’s way of keeping our citizens ignorant of our government’s purpose and operation?</p>
<p>And wouldn’t these citizens who favor such classes scream out if teaching from the Quran were held in our public schools?</p>
<p><em>Lee Knohl, Evanston</em></p>
<p><strong>Setting relations back</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/louis-farrakhan-father-pfleger-st-sabina-anti-semitism-defiant-response-facebook-ban/">Louis Farrakhan set black-Jewish relations back</a>. I cannot call him &#8220;Minister&#8221; because no truly religious person spews hate, intentionally or not. Hopefully, most people will ignore him and regard him as insignificant. He is no Rev. Martin Luther King. What Farrakhan has done calls for a positive response from people of goodwill. As for Father Michael Pfleger, what a disappointment he turned out to be.</p>
<p><em>Alice M. Solovy, Highland Park</em></p>
<p><strong>Totally shocked</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to say, as someone who has always supported Rev. Michael Pfleger, I am totally shocked by his embracing of Minister Louis Farrakhan, and not just the physical embrace.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Pfleger&#8217;s plan here? Is he pandering to certain elements of his parish?</p>
<p>Since Donald Trump became president, there has been a serious spike in anti-Semitism, and I&#8217;m taken aback at  Pfleger&#8217;s very public alliance with Farrakhan, which seems to be a slap in the face at Jews, like me, who have always endorsed his public stances.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very stunning and disappointing.</p>
<p><em>Bob Weil, Highland Park</em></p>

																		<description><![CDATA[Even after the technical challenges are overcome, there will be the public relations stain, one that will take much longer to scrub out.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s become a Facebook trope: airplane passengers posting photos of their 737 Max 8 safety cards, snatched from seat-back pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not bode well,&#8221; wrote Larry Lubell, a Chicago insurance executive on his way to Austin.</p>
<p>A bit dramatic, given that 737 Maxes are grounded while Boeing tries to fix the software glitches that sent two of them crashing into the ground, killing 346 passengers and crew.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>OPINION</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>But also a reminder that even after the technical challenges are overcome, there will be the public relations stain, one that will take much longer to scrub out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boeing&#8217;s Tough Sell: Trust Us&#8221; headlined a story in The New York Times last Thursday, a tale that does not portray a company nimbly cleaning up its mess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boeing is facing credibility problems,&#8221; the story noted. That happens when you not only screw up, but then compound your error by doing a tap dance around the problem.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.boeing.com/">the Boeing website</a>. The second item — already a subtle wink that business goes on — promises &#8220;737 MAX UPDATES.&#8221;</p>
<p>Click on that. Up comes<a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737max/737-max-update.page"> a video of Dennis Muilenburg</a>, chairman, president and CEO of Boeing, his blue eyes harmonizing nicely with his blue shirt; tieless, to show they are in crisis mode.</p>
<p>&#8220;We at Boeing are sorry for the lives lost in the recent 737 Max accidents,&#8221; he begins.</p>
<p>A start. Then again, I am also sorry about any lives lost. Maybe you are, too. That doesn&#8217;t mean we caused them.</p>
<p>&#8220;These tragedies continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and minds,&#8221; Muilenburg continues, &#8220;tragedies&#8221; slyly implying we&#8217;re talking about acts of God, instead of corporate corner-cutting, though hazily suggesting Boeing might have a closer association with these crashes than you or I do. &#8220;And we extend our sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew onboard Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sympathies&#8221; being the new version of &#8220;thoughts and prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us feel the immense gravity of these events across our company &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Myself, I would have found better words than &#8220;immense gravity,&#8221; suggesting, to me anyway, the immense gravity pulling at those two planes as they struggled against Boeing-designed software to stay aloft.</p>
<p>Muilenburg natters on for five minutes, delivering a master class in weaseling. No hint that any kind of mistakes were made, only that Boeing has the know-how to fix them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We own it, and we know how to do it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re taking the time to get the software update right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sidestepping the uncomfortable possibility that had Boeing taken the time to get the software right in the first place, those 346 people would still be alive and Boeing wouldn&#8217;t be scrambling to fix the problem that killed them. Nor would passengers aboard 737s be nervously showing off their safety cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always been relentless focused on safety,&#8221; Muilenburg says. Not according to former Boeing engineers lining up to say that safety was compromised.</p>
<p>What should Boeing do? There is plenty of recent precedent. We are in a golden age of corporate PR disasters, from Facebook to Wells Fargo, and the aircraft manufacturer might want to look there for guidance.</p>
<p>For instance: Volkswagen sold 11 million diesel cars from 2009 to 2015 with computer software written to defeat the anti-pollution controls except when the cars were being tested. The company lost $33 billion in fines and recalls, and two executives went to prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve totally screwed up,&#8221; said VW America boss Michael Horn. That&#8217;s the tone Boeing needs to reach for, though it took VW a few years of turning on the spit of shame to get there.</p>
<p>I, of course, contacted Boeing, which said it would be in touch &#8220;soon,&#8221; though &#8220;soon&#8221; apparently doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;within the next four days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take your time. Breathe in. And try to get it right. Boeing needs to be doing a better job here. Nobody takes pleasure in seeing an American company, with its headquarters in Chicago, slide so thoroughly into the ditch. They&#8217;ve tried talking gibberish and hoping nobody notices. It&#8217;s a bad look. People notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We regret the impact the grounding has had on our customers and their passengers,&#8221; Muilenburg says.</p>
<p>Ya do? Really? Shame you didn&#8217;t also regret, sincerely, the impact the <em>ground</em> had on those 346 passengers and crew, as well regret the central role neglect and bumbling at Boeing seem to have played in putting them there.  But that acknowledgment is coming. It has to.</p>

																		<description><![CDATA[Here's a look at Washington's public option insurance plan set to be signed into law on Monday.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Washington is set to become the first state to enter the private health insurance market with a universally available public option.</p>
<p>A set of tiered public plans will cover standard services and are expected to be up to 10% cheaper than comparable private insurance, thanks in part to savings from a cap on rates paid to providers. But unlike existing government-managed plans, Washington&#8217;s public plans are set to be available to all residents regardless of income by 2021.</p>
<p>The Legislature approved the plan last month, and Gov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to sign it into law Monday.</p>
<p>The move thrusts Washington into the national debate over the government&#8217;s role in health care, with a hybrid model that puts the state to the left of market-only approaches but stops short of a completely public system.</p>
<p>Instead, the state will dictate the terms of the public option plans but hire private insurance companies to administer them, saving the state from having to create a new bureaucracy — and guaranteeing a role for the insurance industry in managing the new public option.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in at least eight other states including Colorado and New Mexico have proposed their own public option measures. In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker pitched <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/illinois-democratic-candidate-governor-jb-pritzker-2018-primary/">IllinoisCares, public health insurance option plan,</a> during his 2018 campaign. But so far none have passed legislation implementing a public option.</p>
<p>Backers acknowledge the rate caps at the heart of the plan risk creating coverage gaps in rural areas. But they hope to persuade doctors to accept lower rates by bringing the state&#8217;s purchasing power to bear. The savings would be used to sell the plans at a competitive price.</p>
<p>Inslee, who is also running for president, embraced the idea based on early work by a state legislator and later officially requested the public option bill.</p>
<p>Its sponsor, Seattle Sen. David Frockt, a Democrat, said the hybrid system was a compromise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s important about this plan is that the government is coming in and taking a more aggressive role in regulating the cost drivers of health care,&#8221; Frockt said.</p>
<p>The core proposition of Washington&#8217;s plan, dubbed Cascade Care, is that it will save consumers money by capping payments to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.</p>
<p>The cost cap is central to the program&#8217;s long-term survival: Set it too high, and there will be no savings to pass along. Set it too low, and the state runs the risk of providers declining the plan, leaving it to whither as consumers seek alternatives that provide more choice, said Jennifer Tolbert, director of the Kaiser Foundation&#8217;s state health care analysis program.</p>
<p>The question is especially critical in Washington&#8217;s rural counties, many of which were already hit hardest by health care cost increases.</p>
<p>To attract providers, Washington lawmakers chose a relatively high figure to start: The plan caps payouts at 160 percent of federal Medicare rates.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s more than other states have proposed. In New Mexico, lawmakers considered using Medicaid rates, among the lowest paid to doctors and hospitals by any insurance plan. Lobbying firm Manatt estimated that could have translated into cost savings for consumers of more than 20% compared with similar private plans on the individual market.</p>
<p>By comparison, Washington&#8217;s higher pay rate for doctors is estimated to save participants only 5 to 10%, according to Jason McGill, Inslee&#8217;s senior policy adviser on health.</p>
<p>But even at the higher rate, the plan risks leaving coverage gaps in the least-populated counties, said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody, an early architect of the plan who chairs the House Health Care and Wellness committee.</p>
<p>The state has already had problems guaranteeing private coverage in those areas. Two counties were recently at risk of having no insurers offering individual plans, and others have only a single hospital or hospital network, allowing providers to drive up costs.</p>
<p>The result has been rural areas bucking the state&#8217;s broader trend of moderate cost increases: A quarter of Washington counties, mostly rural, have seen triple-digit increases in the cost of premiums for a benchmark bronze-level plan in the last year alone, with some rising by as much as three times the increase seen in King County, home of Seattle, according to data from the Kaiser Foundation.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of Washington&#8217;s plan is its hybrid management model.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the public option won&#8217;t be provided by the state itself, and state employees won&#8217;t deal directly with patients.</p>
<p>Instead, the measure directs state health care authorities to hire one or more private insurance companies: The state will determine the broad outlines of the public plans, but private companies will handle day-to-day administration, including enrolling patients and paying out claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an attempt to keep the insurance companies in the game,&#8221; said Aaron Katz, a University of Washington professor who teaches health policy and has studied U.S. health care markets.</p>
<p>Like earlier decisions to have private companies administer parts of the Medicare and Medicaid systems in some states, Washington&#8217;s hybrid model tries to preserve some competition while fixing problems like stability and coverage gaps, Kaatz said.</p>
<p>But it also has the effect of weaving insurance companies further into the fabric of public health care — potentially creating a barrier for later efforts to move to a completely public system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The size of the business that we are giving to private insurers makes it ever more difficult to ever extract ourselves from those dependencies,&#8221; Katz said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a departure from public option proposals that have cropped up in other states, where lawmakers have mostly tried to broaden eligibility for programs like Medicaid, said Emily Blanford of the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Still, a hybrid model theoretically has some advantages, Blanford said, including allowing the state to start from scratch designing rates and provider networks without needing a new program and staff.</p>

																		<description><![CDATA[But dreaming big shouldn’t be limited to Williamson and the first overall pick. He’s not the only player who could help the Bulls turn the corner.]]></description>
																			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re going to dream, dream big.</p>
<p>For the Bulls, the biggest dream is to win the NBA lottery Tuesday night, which would allow them to take Duke star Zion Williamson with the first pick in the June 20 draft.</p>
<p>That would change – what’s the word? &#8212; everything.</p>
<p>That’s not hyperbole. That’s how good and different the kid is.</p>
<p>So let’s dream big. Let’s dream that the Bulls will be the big winners, that they’ll do the right thing, that they won’t do anything stupid. Let’s dream of a core of Williamson, Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine. Let’s dream that a healthy Wendell Carter Jr. is indeed the player the Bulls think he is. Let’s dream that, when you stir all these ingredients together, you have the makings of a championship team down the road.</p>
<p>The Bulls did not give themselves the best chance to win Tuesday’s lottery. They didn’t lose often enough last season, choosing the development of their young players over unabashed tanking and the possibility of getting a once-in-a-generation talent. They finished with the fourth-worst record in the NBA. It means they’ll have a 12.5 percent chance of securing the first pick Tuesday instead of the 14 percent chance the three teams with the worst records each will have. No big deal, many of you are saying. But if this were the 1984 draft, would you rather have a 14 percent chance of getting Michael Jordan or a 12.5 percent chance of getting him?</p>
<p>That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>No one is saying that Williamson has Jordan’s abilities. And maybe Williamson will turn out to be this draft’s Sam Bowie, whom Portland infamously took one spot before Jordan in 1984. But I’ll take my chances on being wrong about Zion.</p>
<p>He’s raw. There’s no doubt about that. He was able to bull his way to the hoop in college. That won’t be as easy in the NBA, where there’s always somebody else to meet you at the rim if you happen to get past your man. He needs to work hard on his outside shot. If he learns to hit a three-pointer consistently, forget it. No one will be able to stop him. There hasn’t been a player with his size (6-foot-7, 284 pounds), his jumping ability (45-inch vertical leap) and his talent in the league.</p>
<p>But dreaming big shouldn’t be limited to Williamson and the first pick. He’s not the only player who could help the Bulls turn the corner.</p>
<p>If they land the second pick in the draft, Murray State’s Ja Morant would answer their need at point guard. He’s extremely gifted. The easiest thing in the world would have been for him to hog the ball at mid-major Murray State. Instead, he led the nation in assists with 10 a game. That was more than two assists per game better than his nearest competitor. He also found time to average 24.5 points a game.</p>
<p>So you can dream big about Morant taking the ball to the hoop for a massive dunk, something you normally wouldn’t expect from someone 6-3, 174 pounds. Or you can dream big about him making the sweet-shooting Markkanen a star.</p>
<p>Maybe Duke’s RJ Barrett will turn out to be the biggest prize of the draft. Maybe the Bulls won’t get as lucky as they had hoped in the lottery but will get lucky enough to pick third when the draft rolls around next month. Barrett averaged 22.6 points a game his freshman year, which is exactly what teammate Williamson averaged.</p>
<p>He likes to have the ball in his hands, and that could be an issue if the ball&#8217;s always in LaVine’s hands. It’s a problem that coach Jim Boylen would love to have.</p>
<p>That’s the lottery – projecting, imagining, dreaming.</p>
<p>Williamson is the massive trophy. He’s a walking, talking, dunking eclipse. But the other two players would be worth celebrating if the Bulls’ logo is on the second or third ping-pong ball selected Tuesday night. It&#8217;s called a win-win-win.</p>
<p>After that, the dreaming goes through significant downsizing. Getting excited will take more effort. Yahoo Sports has the Bulls grabbing Virginia guard De’Andre Hunter with the fourth pick. An ACC assistant coach said of him, “He has the potential to be a great defensive player at the next level.’’ That sounds uncomfortably close to what everybody said about Kris Dunn.</p>
<p>What if the worst happens and the Bulls end up picking eighth in the first round? It could happen. There’s a 2.2 percent chance of that disaster befalling them, but it could happen.</p>
<p>Wait, that’s not the worst thing that could transpire Tuesday! The Bulls could win the lottery and then draft a relatively obscure player whom their scouts absolutely adore! The horror!</p>
<p>OK, calm down, big fella.</p>
<p>This is the time for dreaming big, remember? This is no time to think about the Bulls paying for not playing the rebuild game correctly. This is the time to remember that team vice president John Paxson had a 1.7 percent chance of getting the top pick in the 2008 draft and pulled a rabbit out of his hat, winning the right to take Derrick Rose.</p>
<p>Dream big like that. You’ll sleep much better Monday night.</p>
